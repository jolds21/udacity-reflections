using fc (file compare) to find differences in an old version of a file and new file version is a time saver
pwd # print working directory - shows what directory you are in
ls  # list the files in this directory
cd ~                          # change directories to your home directory
mkdir version-control         # make version-control directory
cd version-control            # go to version-control directory
mkdir reflections             # create reflections directory
cd reflections                # go to reflections directory
subl lesson_1_reflections.txt # launch sublime with file called lesson_1_reflections.txt (you can replace subl with another editor here if you prefer a different one)
